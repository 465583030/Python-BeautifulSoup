For instance, I frequently find it nearly impossible to take a conservative or liberal position on a topic without the other person arguing against related views I do not share. So in the lead up to the Iraq war, taking the position that Saddam didnâ€™t have WMDs meant people would respond with 'yeah, but the war will pay for itself' or perhaps some nonsense about terrorism. Similarly, if I argue minimum wages laws reduce income over the long term, I find I might have to convince the person that I dont think the free market solves everything, that there should be no welfare, etc.

- 'Humans have been eating meat for tens of thousands of yearsâ€_' (Argument from antiquity)
- 'Lions hunt and kill animals. Humans are no different It's natural to eat meat.' (Naturalistic fallacy)
One I hear a lot though, is the question of 'Well what would we do with all the animals that already exist? Should we just kill them? Stop them from reproducing?'
Of course, this has nothing to do with the question of whether it's ethically acceptable to raise and kill animals for food. It may be an unsolved problem, but it doesn't justify a continuation of that policy.
So is this just a red herring? Non-sequitur? The latter also appears a lot, as in 'Harvesting vegetables kills insects!' and 'Vegetables are bad for the environment, too!'

If you're going to be a real skeptic, then the first things you would naturally be skeptical about would be your own beliefs. But instead what I see you doing is jumping to a conclusion made by others for you, that you're just passing along as talking points simply placing your own anecdotal theory in place of evidence: The physical, in vitro, in vivo, user demand and FDA regulatory protections. If you had a leg to stand on, you wouldn't be writing blogs about it, you and hordes of people like you would be actually doing something in court. If it's fraud, it can be proven as such in court. But you've already stipulated that you don't know anything much about the subject, except that you've been told it's implausible. SO how do you or any of the professional whiners expect to win when youâ€™re in a forum other than your own, presided over by an impartial judge? But have you ever posed the question to someone other than Randi, is there any physico-chemical evidence for homeopathy? When your professional witnesses and our professional witnesses have finished testiying, you've lost. So really, in the face of reality, that this is a long practiced form of legal, curative medicine, do you really think you have enough of an argument against it to give you license to defame the Sherrs and others who have medical degrees? Of course not! Skepticism really is nothing more than a name peole give themselves when they want to dismiss or defame something they don't want to believe. And why don't they want to believe? Because they've placed their contempt ahead of their investigation, their nswers ahead of their questions. O how can they know anything if they donâ€™t ask questions? 
For example, if what you mean to say when you call homeopathy 'quackery' is that it's fraud, then why has it not ever won this point when tried in a court of law? Look at what happened to a 'skeptic' organization, the National Council Against Health Fraud, when they tried to sue a homeopathic remedy manufacturer on your point, that homeopathy is fraud. [Google NCAHF vs. King Bio] How do you explain this stupendous loss by the NCAHF?
Now watch what happens in Delarosa vs. Boiron. Watch what happens in the case of the homeopathic veterinarians who are now suing the veterinarian accreditation board. No one can always predict the future, but from what Iâ€™ve seen is that homeopathy always wins and skepticism always loses, and I presume this will hold true for Delarosa and the vets. Wait and see.
Itâ€™s a popular form of medicine worldwide that is growing by 30% a year. Do you really think you're going to stop it by acting stupid?
Homeopathy is amazing medicine when its use as properly. Try it and see for yourself. Meanwhile, allopathy is getting hammered!

I found your blog when tying in various questions in a search engine. I haven't read very much, but what I gathered is that you don't believe in 'alternative' medicine (ex: reiki, using herbs, etc...) It's not cool of anyone to try to convince someone of any belief, but I just want to know why? In my opinion, there is so much proof on why various healing methods that are 'unfounded' work. Will they work for everyone? No. But you won't know until you try. But you the biggest reason why TCM and many other ways of healing work? 

It's because of power of belief and intention. We (humans) don't realize we are capable of so much. We don't realize that we really do have powers, and magic is real. I personally am not a big fan of conventional medicine. But it does have its place. Auras, energy fields, chakras are real. And no, not because, 'well, she said so, therefore it must be true.' I read your post on organic farming. I could go on. And if you interested, let me know. But I will say this: not that there is anything wrong with science proving something true, but why do we need science to validate something? Do we really need science to prove that eating seasonal/local/organic when you can makes sense? Do we really need science to prove that what you does have an effect on you? You mean this isn't common sense, intuitive? Reason and logic has its place. But so does intuition. Intuition will save your life.

Heathre,
 
Thanks for writing. You may also want to look at my other blog, science-based medicine - which has many articles that cover your questions. (http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/)

You make many claims that are unsubstantiated. But let me address one point - does science have to validate a claim that makes sense? The answer is clearly yes. History is strewn with ideas that were intuitive and made sense at the time, but were also hopelessly wrong. Intuition will lead you astray.

There is nothing magical about science - it is simply a systematic way for carefully and thoroughly observing nature and using consistent logic to evaluate the results. So - which part of that exactly do you disagree with? Do you disagree with being thorough, using careful observation, being systematic, or using consistent logic?
 
What I find is that the promoters of so-called alternative medicine cherry pick data, use bad logic, and rely on weak and unreliable evidence. They do this because they wish to promote a world view and ideology, and to promote methods that have not passed the test of careful observation. I disagree with that approach.
 
There are many points that can be made to support my position, but I suggest you spend some time reading articles on SBM if you are interested.

Dear Dr. Novella,

Thank you for writing me back, and quickly too. Intuition is always accurate. If it's ever wrong, it wasn't intuition. I really recommend, The Gift of Fear by Gavin De Becker, and Divine Guidance by Doreen Virtue. I personally don't like using the term alternative when talking about 'alternative' medicine. Because in and of itself, it's not alternative. It's a valid option along side other valid options. Regardless of what your view is, what side your on, whatever topic it may be, if someone is using false evidence, lies etc... they just make them self and their cause look bad. Ex: the extremely hardcore anti-choicers. I'm pro-choice, but if I used lies and BS, then I just look dumb. I know people, who have healed, or may not be 100% cured, but have had some disease, and used many ways from herbs, crystals, food, this, that, etc... and no longer have what they had. We are ultimately are own healer. If you get sick, you can get well. You are responsible for you own life. I will check out your SBM. 

'So - which part of that exactly do you disagree with? Do you disagree with being thorough, using careful observation, being systematic, or using consistent logic?'

What I disagree with, is that science has to validate everything. That if science doesn't prove its true, it's unfounded until proven. Because life has to be 100% factual, as opposed to just common sense. I'm not hardcore anti-science, and there's nothing wrong with it proving something true. But it makes perfect sense, why a local organic (truly organic, not something with just a label) seasonal peach would taste and be more nutritionally dense than one not like that. Plus, organic is real, imperfect. Conventional is uniform. Humans are not uniform.

But here's the thing. Every single person, myself included, projects. What you say about 'alternative' medicine, I can say the same about conventional. Conventional medicine, lies all the time. 'pill for every ill'. People go on 60 medications, and they still suffer. Pharmaceutical companies have no problem taking anyone's money. I do believe there are pills and medicines out there made with good intentions. But most, are not. They want every person, healthy and sick, to be poppin. Conventional medicene, treats the symptom, not the underlying cause. Conventional medicine, doesn't believe in using the mind. Pills, have horrible side effects, that make people worse than before.",,290,"Arguments

Noticed that you really have a huge chip on your shoulder about creationists and yet while your descriptions of the type of arguments they us may be accurate that does not negate their conclusions. Personal opinion on a subject does not automatically make you correct either indeed as there are so many inexplicable things that science cannot fathom simply does not rule out a Creator. Lets face it if there is a Creator of all things then we'd have to pretty much guarantee, irrespective of all possible 'clever' arguments to the contrary His arrogant creations put forward, He would have to be so much smarter than they could ever be.

Isn't it possible, however unlikely, that there is good scientific evidence for a phenomenon that has been overlooked by all of the major publications?  Is this a logical fallacy?

(With guest rogue, Brian Trent )",,272,"There's a type of logical fallacy often used by magicians, creationists, televangelists, and others in the business of deception, that doesn't seem to fit cleanly in any of the named categories. I was hoping to suggest a name for what I consider a category unto itself.

The logical error I'm talking about is what I call the 'Single Cause' fallacy. We've all found ourselves arguing with a creationist and, after thoroughly trouncing one of their claims, we're told that our explanation can't be right, because it doesn't explain something else. Their intent is to make us look like we're waffling when we're forced to say 'No, that was caused by a different mechanism.' After several rounds of this, it's easy to make it look like we're the ones pulling explanations out of our collective asses, rather than having one coherent theory (or dogma) that explains everything. 

Magicians love this tendency. As soon as they've shown that there are no wires attached to their levitating assistant, they know they're free to use all the wires they want for the rest of the act. The audience will assume that there is only one trick being used at a time, and ignore evidence to the contrary.

I know that this contains elements of the false dichotomy and the non-sequitur, and maybe bits and pieces of others. Still, I think this fallacy is common enough, and so attractive to purveyors of nonsense, that it deserves a name of its own. So what do you say: do we launch a new meme in the skeptical community?

This strikes me as some sort of fallacy, but is it an ad hominem, poisoning the well, a red herring, or the genetic fallacy?

On a related note, is there a correct skeptical or scientific answer to ethical issues arising out of IVF, embryonic stell cell research, or cloning?

Salem, MA",,239,"False Analogy

I love the podcast- and look forward to it each week.  However, I do listen to other skeptical podcasts.  One day, the hosts were picking apart an argument and making reference to all of the false analogies therein.  Several of them proffered their own analogies.

Now I agreed with the skeptics, but several days later it dawned on me that someone with a different perspective could potentially accuse the skeptics of creating false analogies.  This got me to thinking.

Much of everyday language is analogy.  Some would say all language is just a series of analogies.  So how can we create analogies that can be demonstrably false from multiple perspectives.  Under what conditions can we 'extend an argument to its logical conclusion.'  Analogies are a wonderful tool for explaining complex issues in a way familiar to the listener, but I want to be able to do this right.

Do you rogues have any thoughts on this?  Should we try to avoid making analogies at all?  I think this would make a good topic for discussion.  Thanks for your consideration.

I have an example of homeopathy apologetics that I guarantee will arouse the bull crap meter in all of you. I thought this might make a great Name That Logical Fallacy segment (where did that segment disappear to?) Anyway here is a quote about why homeopathy is scientific (link provided to the full story below):

'...although homeopaths may not understand how their medicines work, keep in mind that leading contemporary pharmacologists readily acknowledge that there are many commonly prescribed drugs today, including aspirin and certain antibiotics, whose mechanism of action remains unknown, but this gap in knowledge has yet to stop physicians from prescribing them.

Many conventional physicians express doubt about the efficacy of homeopathy, asserting that they will 'believe it when they see it.' It may be more appropriate for them to acknowledge that they will 'see it when they will believe it.' This is not meant as a criticism of conventional physicians as much as of conventional medical thinking. The biomedical paradigm has narrowed the view of, the thinking about, and the practice of medicine to the treatment of specific disease entities with supposedly symptom-specific drugs and procedures. An integral aspect of this approach to medicine is the assumption that the larger the dose of a drug, the stronger will be its effects. While this seems to make sense on the surface, knowledgeable physicians and pharmacologists know that it isn't true. There is a recognized principle in pharmacology called the 'biphasic response of drugs.'1 Rather than a drug simply having increased effects as its dose becomes larger, research has consistently shown that exceedingly small doses of a substance will have the opposite effects of large doses.

The two phases of a drug's action (thus the name 'biphasic') are dose-dependent. For instance, it is widely recognized that normal medical doses of atropine block the parasympathetic nerves, causing mucous membranes to dry up, while exceedingly small doses of atropine cause increased secretions to mucous membranes.'

Amazing. As though science has an agenda regarding evolution. Eric Subject: Re: Tiktaalik That is a very good example of a species that could indeed be a transitional form. Do they have the entire creature in fossil form, I see part of the head? I know that Piltdown Man, which we studied in high school (complete with drawings of a primitive man and his main squeeze) was all fabricated from a pigs molar. I could never figure out how they knew what this guys wife looked like if all they had was one tooth. Very zealous in my opinion. ID people look at this little guy and go, 'So what?' This could just as easily be explained as a creature that God created with these features and the creature has no ancestors and never changed since it first appeared. If all creatures evolved from a very simple life form, then we would expect to see mostly transitional forms in the fossil record and very little variety. To me, there are many more gaps than transitions, and way too much variety. I'm sure there are some very good explainations by creationists out there who are paleontologists, but I would have to do some research to find their specific arguements. BTW, this writers attitude supports my contention that there are very few 'unbiased scientists.' These types obviously WANT evolution to be true just as much as a creationist pastor wants ID to be true.

To assume the role of arbiters as to whether it is science or pseudo-science, on almost everything under the sun... it is simply arrogance... You are using very simplistic arguments, which you call 'logical reasoning', when in many cases things are much more complex... You are acting as if you know everything... every subject matter.

However I was disappointed with your podcast #89 where you trash everything that is not right off what the mainstream-media is telling you. While you bash these 'celebrities' who speak out for 9/11 investigation, you don't notice that obviously you didn't research history really. It's a proven fact that governments have used false-flag operations to get their thing through. Hitler did it with the Reichstags-fire and blamed it on 'communist-terrorists' and then used it as a pretext to implement the enabling-act (which is basically the patriot-act that Bush-Nazi then created with the 9/11 event) and invaded Poland (where Bush then tried to associate 9/11 with Saddam Hussein and Iraq, WMD's). See parallels? Only that example already shows how much suspicion one should have when looking at this topic. You might also remember that grandfather Prescott Bush dealt with Hitler-Nazis back then, so how can you not think that these Bush-Nazis are corrupt up to their skull & bones. They already stole at least one election. Regardless of the physics (steel melting or not, controlled demolition or not, etc.) look at what 9/11 has brought with it and who really benefitted from it: restriction of freedoms, patriot-acts, NSA-spying, Guantanamo Bay, torturing, detention without trial, private contractors in Iraq (Caci, Halliburton, etc.) who were responsible for a lot of the mess that happened at Abu-Ghraib and wasting tax-payers money, military-industrial-complex doing more business than ever, USA turning more and more into a police-state and other scandals over scandals. How much more do you need it in front of your face? Obviously you don't notice how much business is involved in warfare and that not only Cheney's buddys at Halliburton profited but so many others in that military-industrial-complex.

I consider myself to be a pretty skeptical person, but perhaps I am too skeptical. Although I don't typically buy into grand conspiracies, I find myself sometimes skeptical of your criticisms thereof. It seems to me that although it is logically plausible that most if not all grand conspiracies would collapse under their own weight, it seems at least slightly fallacious to say that they can't be true simply because you can't imagine how they would be perpetuated and kept secret. This strikes me as nothing more than an argument from personal incredulity. I think that even the best skeptics must guard at all times against fallacious thinking, after all, none of us are infallible. Thanks for the podcast. Keep up the good work.

Population Statistics...World population growth rate in recent times is about 2% per year. Practicable application of growth rate throughout human history would be about half that number. Wars, disease, famine, etc. have wiped out approximately one third of the population on average every 82 years. Starting with eight people, and applying these growth rates since the Flood of Noah's day (about 4500 years ago) would give a total human population at just under six billion people. However, application on an evolutionary time scale runs into major difficulties. Starting with one 'couple' just 41,000 years ago would give us a total population of 2 x 1089. 9 The universe does not have space to hold so many bodies. 9.

Because it's rubber-like and because the semi-solid 'hook' holds it at an angle, the flagellum takes on a corkscrew shape, acting like a propeller in the water. This is like you being able to spin you head around, and around, and around!  So how does it do it? Scientists are pushing the limits of modern technology to be able to dissect these bacteria to see just how on earth they spin their tails.  It turns out that the bacteria has something that is just like an electric motor built inside of it! When we take a look inside the bacterial flagellum, we see a stator (the C ring, held in place by the STUDS), a rotor (the M & S rings), the drive shaft (the ROD), the bushing or bearing (the L & P rings), it even has what many have called the 'universal joint', the hook - which is what changes the direction of the rotational force. But what of the bacterial motor?  It is no different than the electric motor!  How could it have evolved?  If any one of those parts isn't quite evolved, the whole system breaks down, our bacteria can't get around and it dies!  If any one of those parts suffers a change in its attempt to 'evolve', it no longer does its original job, the whole motor fails, the bacteria dies! In modern times we think something is a superior technology if it's smaller, faster, more energy efficient.  Well, this motor is so small 8,000,000 of them can fit on the tip of one of your hairs!  An electric motor cannot reproduce, or find its own energy, or repair itself!  The bacteria can do all of these.

I have an example of what I think is a logical fallacy, but I'm not sure what type it is. In a discussion of artificial nails, one person in the group insisted that rich women (especially those with 'old money') never get fake nails.  The person said she could always spot fake nails and she never saw them on the rich women she knew. Several people argued with her and one person called her argument the 'toupee fallacy' - she knew a man who insisted he could always spot a toupee, so he always knew whether or not a guy had one.  She told him he couldn't know that - he probably could spot an obvious toupee, but how did he know that there weren't people he saw who looked like they had their own hair but were actually wearing a very realistic toupee.

This prehistoric creature was believed to have possessed both lungs and gills, as well as lobbed-fins and a skeletal and muscular system that enabled it to walk on either the ocean floor or dry land.' 'Today, thanks to the fact that hundreds of them have been caught off the coast of South Africa, the Coelacanth has been nicknamed 'the living fossil.' This so-called living fossil has not only given evolution a black eye, but left evolutionists scratching their heads for an explanation to why the Coelacanth failed to evolve into an amphibian and has remained virtually unchanged for the past 400 million years. Of course, the Coelacanth will eventually evolve, evolutionists assure us, just give it a gazillion years or two.'",,
